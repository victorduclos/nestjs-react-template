Mono repository with NestJS and React with business logic and separated components library.

So, the repository has 4 parts:
- `client` A React application.
- `components` Graphics components used in `client`. The package has hot reload.
- `NestJS` The NestJS application.
- `business-logic` Logic shared between client and server. The package has hot reload.


## How to start it

To initialise the project run `lerna boostrap`


To start the project, run `yarn dev`

Note: I am not sure if NPM works well with this setup so make sure to use yarn as me :D
